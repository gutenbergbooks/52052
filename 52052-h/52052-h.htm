<p>It is hoped that this little book may prove useful, not only in
connection with puzzles for home amusement, but that by inducing
people to consider the various difficulties met with in business and
trade some at least may be led to greater success in dealing with the
practical puzzles and problems of everyday life.</p>

<p>It is the special desire of the author to produce a “sugar-coated
mathematical pill,” as he feels convinced that many can more easily
grasp the truth when it is put before them in a light manner than
when brought forward in the usual orthodox fashion.</p>

<p>No pains have been spared to make the <span class="smcap">Puzzle King</span>
the best of its kind yet produced, and the author here wishes to
thank his many friends who have so kindly assisted him. It would be
well-nigh impossible to individualize; but especial thanks are due
to Thos. Finney, Esq., M.L.A. (Brisbane), for the interest he has
manifested throughout, and the kindly help he has so often rendered
the author.</p>

<p>It might afford our readers some pleasure to know that this work
is entirely Australian. The printers, artist, and author are all
colonial-born, and the production of the former two, at any rate,
will compare favourably with that of any others.</p>

<p>The engravings throughout have been in the hands of Mr. Murray Fraser
and staff, whose experience in this special art has tended to make
the book more attractive than it otherwise would have been.</p>

<p>The author is not above receiving any suggestions or contributions in
the way of peculiar puzzles or commercial comicalities, which might
enhance the value of the book. Intending contributors are invited
to communicate to the address given below, and can rest assured
that they will be remunerated according to the merits of their
communications.</p>

<h2><b>READING BIG NUMBERS.</b></h2>

<hr class="r25" />
<p class="f110"><b>Wonderful Calculations.</b></p>

<p>Although we are accustomed to speak in the most airy fashion of
millions, billions, &amp;c., and “rattle” off at a breath strings of
figures, the fact still remains that we are unable to grasp their
vastness. Man is finite&mdash;numbers are infinite!</p>

<p class="center space-above1">ONE MILLION</p>

<p class="no-indent">Is beyond our conception. We can no more
realise its immensity, than we can the tenth part of a second. It
should be a pleasing fact to note that commercial calculations do not
often extend beyond millions; generally speaking, it is in the realm
of speculative calculation only, such as probability, astronomy,
&amp;c., that we are brought face to face with these unthinkable
magnitudes.</p>

<p>Who, for instance, could form the slightest idea that the odds
against a person tossing a coin in the air so as to bring a head
200 times in succession are</p>
<p class="center">160693804425899027554196209234116260522202993782792835301375</p>
<p class="no-indent">(over I decillion, &amp;c.) to 1 against him?
Suppose that all the men, women and children on the face of the earth
were to keep on tossing coins at the rate of a million a second for
a million years, the odds would still be too great for us to realise
against any one person succeeding in performing the above feat, and
yet the number representing the odds would be only half as long as
the one already given.</p>

<p>Or, who could understand the other equally astounding fact that
Sirius, the Dog-star, is 130435000000000 miles from the earth, or
even that the earth itself is 5426000000000000000000 tons in weight.</p>

<p class="center space-above1">WHAT IS A BILLION</p>

<p>In Europe and America, the billion is 1,000,000,000&mdash;a thousand
millions&mdash;but in Great Britain and her Colonies, a billion is
reckoned 1,000,000,000,000&mdash;a million millions: a difference which
should perhaps be worth remembering in the case of francs and dollars.</p>

<p>One billion sovereigns placed side by side would extend to a distance
of over 18,000,000 miles, and make a band which would pass 736 times
round the globe, or, if lying side by side, would form a golden belt
around it over 26 ft. wide; if the sovereigns were placed on top of
each other flatways, the golden column would be more than a million
miles in height.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Supposing you could count at the rate of 200 a minute; then, in
one hour, you could count 12,000&mdash;if you were not interrupted. Well,
12,000 an hour would be 288,000 a day; and a year, or 365 days,
would produce 105,120,000. But this would not allow you a single
moment for sleep, or for any other business whatever. If Adam at
the beginning of his existence, had begun to count, had continued to
count, and were counting still, he would not even now, according to
the usually supposed age of man, have counted nearly enough. To
count a billion, he would require 9,512 years, 342 days, 5 hours and 20
minutes, according to the above reckoning. But suppose we were to
allow the poor counter twelve hours daily for rest, eating and sleeping,
he would need 19,025 years, 319 days, 10 hours and 40 minutes to
count one billion.</p>

<p class="no-indent">A comparison&mdash;</p>
<p>One million seconds = less than 12 days</p>
<p>&nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; billion&nbsp; &emsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=
over 31,000 years</p>

<p>That the honest man’s services had been requisitioned for the mending
of two saucepans, putting a new handle to an old cleaver, sharpening
three blunted iron skewers, repairing a lantern, and providing a bell
with a clapper is clear enough; and by resolving “a fillup” into “A.
Phillip,” all obscurity is removed from the last two items, but “the
numoraman a bad i” is a nut the reader must crack for himself.

<p>Naturalists state that snakes, when in danger, have been known to
swallow each other; the above three snakes have just commenced to
perform this operation. The snakes are from the same “hatch,” and
are therefore equal in age, length, weight, &amp;c. They all start at
scratch&mdash;that is, commence swallowing simultaneously. They are
twirling round at the express rate of 300 revolutions per minute,
during which time the circumference is decreased by 1 inch.</p>

<p class="center space-above1"><b>A GOOD CARD TRICK.</b></p>

<div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/i_007.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="286" />
</div>
<p>The performer lays upon the table ten cards, side by side, face
downwards. Anyone is then at liberty (the performer meanwhile
retiring from the room) to shift any number of the cards (from one
to nine inclusive) from the right hand end of the row to the left,
but retaining the order of the cards so shifted. The performer, on
his return, makes a little speech: “Ladies and gentlemen, you have
shifted a certain number of these cards. Now, I don’t intend to ask
you a single question. By a simple mental calculation I can ascertain
the number you have moved, and by my clairvoyant faculty, though the
cards are face downwards, I shall pick out one corresponding with
that number. Let me see” (pretends to calculate, and presently turns
up a card representing “five”). “You shifted five cards and I have
turned up a five, the exact number.”</p>

<p>The cards moved are not replaced, but the performer again retires,
and a second person is invited to move a few more from right to
left. Again the performer on his return takes up the correct card
indicating the number shifted. The trick, unlike most others, may be
repeated without fear of detection.</p>

<p>The principle is arithmetical. To begin with, the cards are arranged,
unknown to the spectators, in the following order:</p>

<p>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it will be found that, however many are shifted
from right to left, the <i>first</i> card of the new row will indicate
their number. Thus, suppose <i>three</i> are shifted. The new order of the
cards will then be:</p>

<p><i>Three</i>, two, one, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four.</p>

<p>So far, the trick is easy enough, but the method of its continuance
is a trifle more complicated. To tell the position of the indicating
card after the second removal, the performer privately adds the
number of that last turned up (in this case <i>three</i>) to its place in
the row&mdash;<i>one</i>. That gives us <i>four</i>, the card to be turned up
after the next shift will be the fourth. Thus, suppose six cards are now
shifted, their new order will be:</p>

<p>Nine, eight, seven, <i>six</i>, five, four, three, two, one, ten.</p>

<p>Had five cards only been shifted, the <i>five</i> would have been
fourth in the row, and so on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The performer now adds <i>six</i>, the number of the card, to its place
in the row, <i>four</i>: the total, <i>ten</i>, gives him the position of
the indicator for the next attempt. Thus, suppose four cards are next
shifted, the new order will be:</p>

<p>Three, two, one, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, <i>four</i>.</p>

<p>The next calculation, 4 and 10, gives us a total 14. The ten is, in
this case, cancelled, and the fourteen regarded as <i>four</i>, which
will be found to be the correct indicator for the next shifting.</p>

<p>It looks more mystifying if the performer be blindfolded, for he can
tell the position of the cards with his fingers. Keeping his hand
on the card, he asks, “Will you please tell me how many cards were
shifted?” As soon as the answer is given, he exhibits the card, and
can continue the trick as long as he pleases.</p>

<h2>SOME CURIOUS NUMBERS.</h2>

<p>If the number 37 be multiplied by 3, or any multiple of 3 up to 27,
the product is expressed by three similar digits. Thus&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="ifrst">37 × 3 = 111</li>
<li class="indx">37 × 6 = 222</li>
<li class="indx">37 × 9 = 333</li>
</ul>

<p>The products succeed each other in the order of the digits read
downwards, 1, 2, 3, etc., these being multiplied by 3 (their number
of places) reproduce the multiplicand of 37.</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="ifrst">1 × 3 = 3</li>
<li class="indx">2 × 3 = 6</li>
<li class="indx">3 × 3 = 9</li>
</ul>

<p>If it be multiplied by multiples of 3, beyond 27, this peculiarity is
continued, except that the extreme figures taken together represent
the multiple of 3 that is used as a multiplier. Thus&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="ifrst">37 × 30 = 1110, extreme figures, 10</li>
<li class="indx">37 × 33 = 1221&nbsp; &nbsp;  &emsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &emsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp;  &emsp;11</li>
<li class="indx">37 × 36 = 1332&nbsp; &nbsp;  &emsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &emsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp;  &emsp;12</li>
</ul>

<p>The number 73 (which is 37 inverted) multiplied by each of the
numbers of arithmetical progression 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc., produces
products terminating (unit’s place) by one of the ten different
figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. These figures will be found in
the reverse order to that of the progression, 73 × 3 produces 9, by 6
produces 8, and 9 produces 7, and so on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Another number which falls under some mysterious law of series is
142,857, which, multiplied by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 gives the same
figures in the same order, beginning differently; but if multiplied
by 7, gives all 9’s.</p>

<p class="center space-above1"><b>Do Figures Lie?</b></p>

<p>“Figures cannot lie,” is a very old saying. Nevertheless, we can
all be deceived by them. Perhaps one of the best instances of them
leading us astray is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>An employer engaged two young men, A and B, and agreed to pay them
wages at the rate of £100 per annum. A enquires if there is to be a
“rise,” and is answered by the employer, “Yes, I will increase your
wages £5 every six months.” “Oh! that is very small; it’s only £10
per year,” replied A. “Well,” said the employer, “I will double it,
and give you a rise of £20 per year.” A accepts the situation on
those terms.</p>

<p>B, in making his choice, prefers the £5 every six months. At the
first glance, it would appear that A’s position was the better.</p>

<p>A spieler at a Country Show amused the people with the following
game:&mdash;He had 6 large dice, each of which was marked only on one
face&mdash;the first with 1, the second 2, and so on to the sixth, which
was marked 6. He held in his hand a bundle of notes, and offered to
stake £100 to £1 if, in throwing these six dice, the six marked faces
should come up only once, and the person attempting it to have 20

very disadvantageous to those who wagered with him, it is certain
there were a great many chances against them.</p>

would give the marked faces; the odds, therefore, in doing this

<p>It should be observed that the figures of the answer to the
subtraction when added together equal 27&mdash;a multiple of 9; this,
of course, is always the case. Now, suppose that 7 was the figure
crossed out, then the sum of the figures in the answer (omitting 7)
would be 20; this number being told by the person, it is easily
seen that 7 must have been crossed out, as that figure is required
to complete the multiple 27. If after the figure has been crossed
out, the remaining figures total a multiple of 9, it is evident that
either a cipher or a 9 must have been the figure erased.</p>

<p class="center">THE PUZZLE ABOUT THE “PER CENTS.”</p>

<p>There are many persons engaged in business who often become badly
mixed when they attempt to handle the subject of per centages. The
ascending scale is easy enough: 5 added to 20 is a gain of 25%; given
any sum of figures the doubling of it is an addition of 100%. But
the moment the change is a decreasing calculation the inexperienced
mathematician betrays himself, and even the expert is apt to stumble
or go astray. An advance from 20 to 25 is an increase of 25%; but the
reverse of this, that is, a decline from 25 to 20 is a decrease of
only 20%.</p>

<p>There are many persons, otherwise intelligent, who cannot see why the
reduction of 100 to 50 is not a decrease of 100%, if an advance from
50 to 100 is an increase of 100%.</p>

<p>The other day, an article of merchandise which had been purchased
at 10 pence a pound was resold at 30 pence a pound&mdash;an advance of
200%. Whereupon, a writer in chronicling the sale said that at the
beginning of the recent depression several invoices of the same class
of goods which had cost over 30 pence per pound had been finally sold
at 10 pence per pound&mdash;a loss of over 200%! Of course there cannot
be a decrease or loss of more than 100%, because this wipes out the
whole investment and makes the price nothing. An advance from 10 to
30 is a gain of 200%; but a decline of 30 to 10 is a loss of only 66⅔%.</p>

<p>A very deserving trader was ruined by his miscalculations respecting
mercantile discounts. The article he manufactured he at first
supplied to retail dealers at a large profit of about 30%. He
afterwards confined his trade almost exclusively to large wholesale
houses, to whom he charged the same price, but allowed a discount of
20%, believing that he was still realising 10% for his own profit.
His trade was very extensive, and it was not till after some years
that he discovered the fact that in place of making 10% profit, as
he imagined, by this mode of making his sales he was realising only
4%. To £100 value of goods he added 30%, and invoiced them at £130.
At the end of each month, in the settlement of accounts amounting to
some thousands of pounds with individual houses, he deducted 20%, or
£26 on each £130, leaving £104, value of goods at prime cost, instead
of £110, as he all along expected.</p>

<p class="center space-above2">MIND-READING WITH CARDS.</p>

<p>Hand the pack (a full one) to be shuffled by as many spectators
as wish; then propose that someone takes the pack in his hand and
secretly chooses a card, not removing it, but noticing at what number
it stands counting from the bottom; he then returns the pack to you.</p>

<p>Now you have to tell what number the card is from the top. You ask
any one of the spectators to choose any number between 40 and 50, and
whatever number is chosen the card will appear at that number in the
pack. Let us suppose the number chosen is 48.</p>

<p>You then say that it is not necessary for you to even see the cards,
which will give you a good excuse for holding them under the table,
or behind your back. Now subtract the number chosen, 48, from 52,
which gives remainder 4, count off that many cards from the top, and
place them at the bottom. You next say to the gentleman who chooses
the card, that “it is now number 48, according to the general desire,
would you please let us know at what number it originally stood?”
Suppose he answers 7. Then, in order to save time, you commence
counting from the top at that number, dealing off the cards one by
one, calling the first card 7, the next 8, and so on. When you reach
48, it will be the card the gentleman had chosen. It is not necessary
to limit the choice of position to between 40 and 50, but it is
better for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, that the number chosen be higher than that at which the card
first stood, also the higher the number chosen, the fewer cards are
there to slip from the top to the bottom.</p>

place: in a wheel on a fixed axle the bottom moves backward as fast
as the top moves forward; but in a wheel that is going forward,
drawn by a progressive axle, the bottom does not go back at all, but
remains almost stationary until it is its turn to rise and go forward.</p>

<p class="center">MAGIC SQUARES.</p>

<p>A Magic Square is a series of figures arranged in the equal divisions
of a square in such a manner that the figures in each row when added
up, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, form exactly the
same sum.</p>

<div class="figright">
    <img src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="300" />
</div>

<p>They have been called “Magic” because the ancients ascribed to them
great virtues, and because this arrangement of numbers formed the
basis and principle of their talismans. Archimedes devoted a great
amount of attention to them, which has caused a great many to speak
of them as “the squares of Archimedes.” They may be either odd or
even. When the former, the following method will be found valuable:&mdash;</p>

<p>With the digits from 1 to 25 form a square so that the numbers when
added up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally will amount to 65.</p>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Imagine an exterior line of squares above the magic square
you wish to form, and another on the right hand of it. These two
imaginary lines are shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>1st. In placing the numbers in the square, we must go in the
ascending diagonal direction from left to right, any number which, by
pursuing this direction, would fall into the exterior line must be
carried along that line of squares, whether vertical or horizontal,
to the last square. Thus, 1 having been placed in the centre of the
top row, 2 would fall into the exterior square above the fourth
vertical line; then ascending diagonally 3 falls into the square
diagonally from 2, but 4 falls out of it to the end of a horizontal
line, and it must be carried along that line to the extreme left and
there placed. Resuming our diagonal ascension to the right we place 5
where the reader sees it, and would place 6 in the middle of the top
row, but as we find 1 is already there we look for the direction to</p>

<p>2nd. That when in ascending diagonally we come to a square already
occupied, we must place the number which, according to the 1st rule
should go into that occupied square directly under the last number
placed: thus, in ascending with 4, 5, 6, the 6 must be placed under
the 5, because the square next to 5 in diagonal direction is occupied.</p>

<p class="center">HOW TO FIND THE TOTAL OF A ROW OF<br />FIGURES IN A MAGIC SQUARE.</p>

<p><i>Rule.</i>&mdash;Multiply half the sum of the extremes by the square root of
the greatest extreme.</p>

<p>Referring to the example given above, we see that the extremes 1 and
25 added equal 26&mdash;half of which is 13; this multiplied by 5 (the
square root of 25) gives 65 as the total for each row.</p>

<p>Again, in the next question, the two extremes 1 and 81 equal 82, half
of this sum is 41, which multiplied by 9 (the square root of 81)
gives 369 as the total for each row.</p>

<p class="center">HOW THEY WORKED IT.</p>

<p>Mick and Pat, working in the country some distance from a hotel,
arranged with the landlord to take to their hut a small keg of rum.
They were unable to pay for the liquor at the time, having only one
threepenny piece between them; but Mick proposed that every time he
had a drink he would give Pat threepence, and Pat also agreed to
pay Mick for his drinks, the cash thus gathered to be brought to
the publican when the keg was empty. This proposal was accepted by
the publican, the keg of rum handed over to the two Irishmen, who
immediately started on their journey. They had not proceeded very far
before their burden made them thirsty. Mick is the first to pull up
with: “Hold on, Pat, I think I’ll have a drink.” “Begorra,” replied
Pat, “you’ll have to pay me for it then.” Mick hands the 3d. to Pat
before having a good “pull.” Pat now being the possessor of the price
of a drink, slakes his thirst by paying Mick 3d. for it. This form
of payment is kept up till the rum has disappeared. On their next
visit to the hotel, the 3d piece is handed to the landlord as being
payment, according to terms of agreement adopted by him.</p>

<p class="center">A “TAKE-DOWN” WITH CARDS.</p>

<p>This is a card trick which depends upon a certain “key,” the
possessor of which will always have the advantage over his
uninstructed adversary. It is played with the first six of each
suit&mdash;the four aces in one row, next row the deuces, threes,
fours, fives and sixes. The object now will be to turn down cards
alternately, and endeavour to make thirty-one points by so turning
without over-running that number. The chief point is to count so as
to end with the following numbers: 3, 10, 17 or 24.</p>

<p>For instance, we will suppose it your privilege to commence the
count; you would commence with 3, and your adversary would add 6,
which would make 9; it would be then your policy to add 1 and make
10; then, no matter what number he adds he cannot prevent you making
17, which gives you the command of the trick. We will suppose he adds
6 and make 16; then you add 1 and make 17; then he to add 6 and make
23, you add 1 and make 24; then he cannot add any number to make 31,
as the highest number he can add is 6, which would only count 30, so
that you can easily add the remaining 1 and make 31.</p>

<p>If your adversary is not wary, you may safely turn indifferent
numbers at the beginning, trusting to his ignorance to let you count
17 or 24; but, as his knowledge increases, he will soon learn that 24
is a critical number, and to play for it accordingly.</p>

<p>If both players know the trick, the first to play must be the winner,
as he is sure to begin with a 3, which commands the game.

<div class="figright">
    <img src="images/i_030.jpg" alt="_" width="200" height="197" />
</div>
<p>Ask a person to think of any number on the dial of a clock; you then
point, promiscuously at the various numbers, telling the person to
add the number of times you point to the number he thought of, and
when the total reaches 20, you will be pointing at the number he selected.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose he selected the number 5. You point
indifferently 7 times at the various numbers, but the 8th time your
pointer must be at XII., his addition will then be 13 (for 5 and 8
added equal 13), the next at XI., his addition then 14, next at X.,
and so on. When he calls 20, you will be pointing at the number he
thought of&mdash;5.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>A very amusing experiment is to ask a person to write down the
figures around the dial of a clock. Nearly all know that the figures
are generally the Roman numerals; but, in writing them down, when
they come to the four, it is very often written IV. instead of IIII.</p>

<p>It is said that a certain king, being unable to find any other fault
in a clock that had been constructed for him, declared that the
figure four should be represented by four strokes (IIII) instead
of IV. In vain did the clock-maker point out the mistake, for his
majesty adhered obstinately to his own opinion, and angrily ordered
the alteration to be made. This was done, and the precedent thus
formed has been followed by clockmakers ever since.</p>

<h2>Interesting Items About the Almanac.</h2>

<p>The reason why February has only 28 days, while the other months have
30 and 31 is attributable to the vanity of the Emperor Augustus.
His uncle and predecessor corrected the calendar, arranging the
year almost as we have it now; he gave to the year 12 months, or
365¼ days. The months were&mdash;March (the first month), April, May,
June, Quintilis, Sextiles, September, October, November, December,
January, and February (the latter being the last month of the year,
which among the Romans had consisted originally of 10 months). Cæsar
ordered that the year should begin with January, and divided the
days among them thus: January, March, May, Quintilis, September,
and November each had 31 days; April, June, Sextiles, October and
December had 30 days each; and February (the last month added to the
year) had 29 days regularly and a 30th day every fourth year. After
Julius Cæsar’s death, Mark Antony changed the name of Quintilis to
July as we have it now. Augustus wanted a month for himself, and
wanted it as long as his uncle’s month, so he took Sextiles for his
and changed the name to August. Then he took February’s 29th day and
added it to August, so that it might have 31 days; and, to avoid
having 3 months of 31 days each in succession, September and November
were reduced to 30 days, and October and December increased to 31
days each.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>Previous to the year 1752, the legal year in England commenced on
the 25th March. In that year it was enacted that the legal year
should begin on 1st January. The change brought the calendar into
unison with the actual state of the solar year. It is curious that
in Scotland the change which made the legal year begin on January
1st was effected in 1600. For some time after the change in England,
legal documents contained two dates for the period intervening
between 1st January and 25th March&mdash;that of the old year and that of
the new.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>During the time of Oliver Cromwell, Christmas Day was described as a
superstitious festival, and put down in England by the strong hand of
the law.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>There has been a superstitious notion that Fools’ Day dated back to
the time of Noah’s Ark. The dove that was sent forth from the Ark is
supposed to have returned on April 1st.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p><span class="smcap">The Most Remarkable Month</span> was February, 1866. It had no full
moon. January had two full moons, and so had March, but February had
none. This had not occurred since the creation of the world, and it
will not occur again, so scientists tell us.

<p><i>All Fools’ Day</i> had it’s origin in France, before the time of the
Reformed Calendar. When the year commenced on March 25th, the French
frequently paid their New Year’s visits and bestowed their gifts on
April 1st, as March 25th occurred in Passion Week. After the adoption
of the new calendar, however, these New Year’s observances took place
on January 1st, and it was a common thing for people to forget the
change of date. Pretended presents and mock ceremonial visits became
common, and the persons thus imposed on were known as April fish,
<i>i.e.</i>, a mackerel, which, like a fool, is easily caught. Hence,
All Fools’ Day.</p>

<p>“Please, I want a pound of tripe,” said a boy, sauntering up.
“Where’s your money?” demanded old Buggus, hoping to put the boy out

<p class="center">PROFITABLE CARELESSNESS.</p>

<p>A very amusing story is told of a harness-maker who lived some years
ago in London. He had a handsome saddle in his shop, occupying a
conspicuous position therein. On his return from luncheon one day he
observed that the saddle was gone. Calling to his foreman, he said:</p>

<p>“John, who has bought the saddle?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know, sir,” said the foreman, scratching his head
as if he were trying to think. “I cannot tell, and the worst part of
it is, it hasn’t been paid for. While I was at work in the back of
the shop a gentleman came in, priced it, decided to take it, told
me to charge it, and throwing it into his trap, drove off, before I
could think to ask his name.”</p>

<p>“That was very stupid of you,” said the harness-maker, disposed to be
angry at the man’s carelessness. “Very likely we have been robbed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that sir,” said the foreman, “for I’m very sure that
the gentleman has traded here before.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t afford to lose the money,” said the harness-maker.
“We’ll have to find out who took it and send him the bill. Ah!” he
added, with a smile, after a moment’s reflection, “I have it. We’ll
charge it up to the account of every one of our customers who keep
open accounts here. Those who didn’t get it will refuse to pay, so we
shall be all right.”</p>

<p>“The book-keeper was instructed to do this, and the bills in due
course of time went out. Some weeks later the harness-maker asked the
book-keeper if he had succeeded in discovering who the customer was.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he replied, “and we never shall, I fear, sir, for about
40 people have paid for it already without saying a word.”

<p class="center">TO TELL THE SPOTS ON THE<br />BOTTOM CARDS OF SIX HEAPS.</p>

<p>Allow anyone to choose six cards from a full pack. Tell him the
court cards count 10, and the other cards according to their pips.
Having made his selection, tell him to lay the chosen cards upon the
table face downwards, without allowing you to see them, and to place
upon each as many cards as pips are required to make 12. Whilst he
is doing so, you should be out of the room or blindfolded. On your
return he hands you the cards left over, and you have to tell the
total number of spots on the six bottom cards.</p>

<p>Suppose he had chosen 10, 6, 1, K, 3 and 7, which totals 37, now
on the 10, he would place two cards to make 12; on the 6, he would
place 6; and on the 1, 11 would be placed, and so on. On receiving
the remaining cards from him you pretend to be looking through them
carefully, but you simply want to know how many he has given you,
which in the above example would be 11. To this number you add 26,
which gives 37, the total spots required.</p>

<p>Should there not be enough cards left on hand to complete the six
heaps, you can ask him how many cards he is short of, and this
number, subtracted from 25, will give the total. It is better not to
allow the person to choose six cards right off at the beginning, but
for him to shuffle and cut the pack as he pleases, and to take the
cards as they come.</p>

answer respectable, and tell just how it was. A boy thinks himself
clever because he can wade where it is deep, but God made the dry
land for every living thing, and rested on the seventh day. When the
boy grows up he is called a husband, and then he stops wading and
stays out at nights, but the grew up girl is a widow and keeps house.”</p>

<p class="center">HIS OWN GRANDFATHER.</p>

<p>The complication of relationship brought about by marriage is the
cause of many a family squabble, but it is seldom one hears of fatal
results attending such matters. According to an American newspaper,
a resident of Pennsylvania committed suicide a few days ago from a
melancholy conviction that he was his own grandfather.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of a singular letter he left:&mdash;“I married a
widow who had a grown-up daughter. My father visited our house very
often, fell in love with my step-daughter, and married her. So my
father became my son-in-law and my step-daughter my mother, because
she was my father’s wife. Some time afterwards my wife had a son; he
was my father’s brother-in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother
of my step-mother. My father’s wife&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, my step-daughter&mdash;had
also a son; he was, of course, my brother, and in the meantime
my grandchild, for he was the son of my daughter. My wife was my
grandmother, because she was my mother’s mother. I was my wife’s
husband and grandchild at the same time. And as the husband of a
person’s grandmother is his grandfather, I was my own grandfather.”
Thus he died, a martyr to his own existence.</p>

<p class="center">THE ORIGIN OF THE “STONE.”</p>

<p>Measurement of weight by the “stone” arose from the old custom
farmers had of weighing wool with a stone. Every farmer kept a large
stone at his farm for this purpose. When a dealer came along he
balanced a plank on top of a wall, and put the stone on one end of it
and the bags of wool on the other, until the weights were equal. At
first the stones were of all sorts and sizes and weights, with the
result that dealers who wished to make a living had to be remarkably
knowing in their estimates of them. The many inconveniences involved
by this inequality resulted in all stones being made of a uniform
weight as far as wool was concerned. The weight of a stone of
potatoes, meat, glass, cheese, &amp;c., all differ.</p>

<p>Illusions of the Eye are numberless, and afford a wide field for

really do deceive us unless they have been tested in the proper
manner. For instance, if you ask anyone to what height a bell-topper
would reach if placed on the floor against the wall, nine times out
of ten the height guessed will be half as much again as the real
height of the hat. Everyone seems to <i>over</i>-estimate the proper height.</p>

really they are parallel. The illusion is more striking if you tilt the leaf up.

<p>“It used to be used for purposes of Exploration, but it has no
interior, and you can’t explore it. Sometimes it is called Antipides,
because everything is upside down there. The chief products are Wool
and Gold and other Exports and the Austrailyan eleven come from
there. The Climate is hot in the Summer and not so in the Winter,
which causes drowts and sweeps all the sheep away and the banks break.</p>

through the air with great skill and then they return again right to
your feet. The natives are coloured Black and they call themselves
Aboriginels, they subsist on bark and other food they do no work and
chop wood for a miserable living and can smell the ground like a
dog. When we go there they call us new Chums. They have no form of
Worship, and pray for rain, but a belief in Federashun because they
want to be joined together.</p>

Bushrangers and the Melbourne Cup which sticks people up and takes
from them all they have got.</p>

him to set out on the river shore a row of trees, no two of which
should be any further apart than any other two. The trial proved

and in despair drowned himself in the river. Perhaps some of you

<p>Here is a good story of how a father cured his son of verbal

words that the father replied with the following letter:&mdash;“In
promulgating your esoteric cogitations, or articulating superficial
sentimentalities, and philosophical or pscyhological observations,
beware of platitudinous ponderosity. Let your conversation possess
a clarified conciseness, compacted comprehensibleness, coalescent
consistency, and a concatenated cogency. Eschew all conglomerations
of flatulent garrulity, jejune babblement, and asinine affectations.
Let your extemporaneous descantings and unpremeditated expatiations
have intelligibility, without rhodomontade or thrasonical bombast.
Sedulously avoid all polysyllabical profundity, pompous prolixity,
and ventriloquial vapidity. Shun double entendre and prurient
jocosity, whether obscure or apparent. In other words, <i>speak
truthfully, naturally, clearly, purely, but do not use big words</i>.”</p>

to be £6000. “It canna be&mdash;count again,” said the old man. The clerk
did count again, and again declared the balance to be £6000. Time
after time he cast up the columns&mdash;it was still a 6, and not a 4,
that rewarded his labours. So the old merchant, on the strength of
his good fortune, modernised his house, and put money in the purse
of the carpenter, the painter, and the upholsterer. Still, however,
he had a lurking doubt of the existence of the extra £2000; so one
winter’s night he sat down to give the columns “one count more.” At
the close of his task he jumped up as though he had been galvanised,
and rushed out in a shower of rain to the house of the clerk, who,
capped and drowsy, put out his head from an attic window at the sound

for rations. “Well,” said the manager, “I have a job that will take 200 hours
to complete; if you want to do it, you can divide the work and the money
among yourselves as you see fit.” The sundowners agreed to do the
work on these conditions. “Now, mates,” said the laziest of them,
“it’s no good all of us doing the same amount of work. Let’s toss
up to see who shall work the most hours a day, and who the fewest.
Then let each man work as many days as he does hours a day.” This
was agreed to; but the proposer took good care that chance should
designate him to do the least number of hours of work. How were the
200 hours put in so that each man should work as many hours as days,
and yet no two men work the same number of hours?</p>

<p class="center"><b><big>NUMBER 7.</big></b></p>

<p>The number 7 has always been considered the most sacred of all our
figures. Its prominence in the Scriptures is very remarkable, from
Genesis&mdash;where we read that the seventh day was consecrated as a day
of rest and repose&mdash;to Revelations&mdash;where we find the seven churches
of Asia; seven golden candlesticks; the book with seven seals; the
seven angels with seven trumpets; seven kings; seven thunders; seven
plagues, &amp;c., &amp;c., its frequent occurrence is most striking.</p>

<p>The Ancients paid great respect to the seven mouths of the Nile.
The seven rivers of Vedic India; seven wonders of the world; seven
precious stones; seven notes of music; seven colours of the rainbow,
&amp;c., &amp;c. The “Lampads seven that watch the Throne of Heaven” led
the Chaldeans to esteem the unit 7 as the holiest of all numbers,
thereupon they established the week of seven days, and built their
temples in seven stages. The temples and palaces of Burma and China
are seven-roofed.</p>

<p>In modern times this number has kept up its reputation. Shakespeare
paid special regard to it; the “seven ages” and every multiple of it
is supposed to be a critical or important period in one’s life.</p>

<p class="center">THE ADVANTAGES OF SKILFUL BOOK-KEEPING.</p>

<p>If a merchant wishes to get pretty deeply in debt, and then get rid
of his liabilities by bankruptcy&mdash;if, in fact, he proposes to himself
to go systematically into the swindling business, and engage in
wholesale pecuniary transactions without a shilling of his own, the
first thing he should take care to learn would be the whole art of book-keeping.</p>

<p>From what may occasionally be seen of the reports of the proceedings
in bankruptcy, it is found that <i>well kept books</i> are regarded as
quite a test of honesty, and though assets may have disappeared or
never have existed, though large liabilities may have been incurred
without any prospect of payment, the bankrupt will be complimented
on the straight look of his dealings, if he has shown himself a good book-keeper.</p>

<p>To common apprehension it would seem that well kept books would only
help to show a reckless trader the ruinous result of his proceedings,
and that while the man <i>without</i> books might flatter himself that
all would come out right at last, the man with exact accounts would
only get into hot water with his eyes open. If a man may trade on
the capital of others without any of his own, and get excused on the
ground that he has kept his books correctly, it is difficult to see
why a thief who steals purses, &amp;c., may not plead in mitigation of
punishment that he has carefully booked the whole of his transactions.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know the effect of producing a ledger
on a trial for felony, as well as curious to observe whether a
burglar would be leniently dealt with on the ground that his
house-breaking accounts gave proof of his experience in the science
of “double-entry.”</p>

<p>The well known author of several works on account-keeping, Mr.

Zealand some time back. Mr. Yaldwyn was at the time engaged examining
the books in one of the offices in a country town, and enquired
from one of the clerks standing near if the ledger were posted.
The person appealed to answered that “he didn’t know,” whereupon
Mr. Y. said that he required it done, and with as little delay as
possible. A few minutes later the same individual came rushing in and
informed him that the ledger was “posted.” Such a piece of “lightning
book-keeping” so surprised Mr. Y. that he further questioned the man,
who replied “You said you wanted the ledger posted, and, begorra, I
posted it.” It then dawned upon Mr. Yaldwyn that the clerk, who was
an Irishman, had actually <i>posted</i> the book in the post office!</p>

<p>Two concrete numbers cannot be multiplied together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>In the example just given, 2s. multiplied by 3, we see it simply
means to write down 2s. three times, and by addition we discover the
answer to be 6s. Suppose the reader lent a friend 2s. on Monday, 2s.
on Tuesday, and 2s. on Wednesday, he has lent 2s. three times, making
6s. lent in all.</p>

<p>Now, we will attempt to multiply 2s. by 3s., but it is impossible
to comprehend how many times is 3s. times. The answer to 2s. x 3s.
usually given is 6s. On the same lines, we multiply 9d. by 10d., and
our answer is&mdash;90d., that is 7s. 6d.&mdash;a greater product than 2s.
multiplied by 3s.</p>

<p>Although it is stated that two concrete numbers cannot be multiplied
together, it should be borne in mind that we can multiply yards,
feet, and inches, by yards, feet, and inches (length by breadth),
which will result in square or cubic measure: 12 inches make 1 foot,
and 3 feet make one yard, 144 square inches make 1 square foot, &amp;c.
12 pence make 1 shilling, but how many square pence make 1 square shilling?</p>

<p>The argument generally brought forward in favour of the performance
of this problem is, that when the Rule of Three is applied to
financial questions (such as interests, &amp;c.) money is multiplied by money.</p>

<p>Example.&mdash;If the interest on £10 is 15s., what is the interest on £20?</p>

<p class="center">As £10 : £20 :: 15s. : <i><b><big>x</big></b></i></p>

</table>

<p>The multiplication in the above is in appearance only, for all we get
in the Rule of Three is the ratio between the sums of money and this
ratio is an abstract number, and not concrete. On examination we find
the ratio between £10 and £20; that the latter is double, or <i>two</i>
times as much as the former, and not £2 times more than it.</p>

<p>We extend a general invitation to all our readers who hold a
different opinion to multiply three pints of Dewar’s Whisky by 6
quarts of soda-water, but in case they might plead inability to
perform this little feat, on conscientious grounds, we will extend
the invitation to three cups of tea by six spoonfuls of sugar. And if
any of them have a few pounds (say £10) in the Savings Bank we would
advise “Don’t <i>add</i> any more deposits, but wait till you have £2,
then proceed to the bank and multiply the £10 by the £2, and prove
to the teller that you have £20 to your account. Be careful to take
no less a sum than £2, or the result might be a little surprising,
for if you take only £1, the teller might argue after he has received
your sovereign that “ten ones are ten,” and then your £10 would
remain the same.”</p>

<p>“<i>In any right-angled triangle, the square which is described
upon the side opposite to the right-angle is equal to the squares
described upon the sides which contain the right-angle.</i>”</p>

<p>Here is a simple way of proving this proposition. Although perhaps
not exactly scholastic, it is none the less interesting.</p>

<p>Draw an exact square, whose sides measure 7 in.; then divide it into
49 square inches. Having done this, cut the figure in following the
big lines as shown by Fig 1. It will be observed that C is a complete
square, and that A and B will form a square: but as D is 1 in. short
of being a square, it is necessary to cut a square inch and add it on.</p>

    <p class="f120"><b>Fig. 2.</b></p>

<p>Then construct a right-angled triangle as shown by Figure 2.</p>

<p>We then see that the sum of the two small squares is equivalent to
the large square.</p>

<ul class="index"><li>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;D contains&nbsp; 9 small squares.</li>

<li class="isub4 over">25</li>
</ul>

<p>And as we see that C has 25 small squares, it is thus proved that the
sum of the squares upon the sides which contain the right angle are
equal to the squares upon the side opposite the right angle.</p>

<p class="center">THE PUZZLE ABOUT THE “PROFITS.”</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no form of commercial calculation so confusing
and so little understood as that of mercantile profits. It might
surprise many to state, nevertheless it is perfectly true, that it is
impossible to buy goods and sell them to show a profit as great as
100 per cent.</p>

<p>The correct method to calculate profit is to reckon on the
<i>return</i>&mdash;the price received for the goods sold&mdash;<i>not on
the cost price</i>, and as it is impossible to sell goods at 100 per
cent. discount, so also goods cannot be sold to show that percentage
of profit, unless they actually cost nothing.</p>

<p>Some time ago, in New Zealand, a well-known boot manufacturer had a
“GREAT DISCOUNT SALE.“ He had large posters displayed on the windows
of his shops, and advertisements in the newspapers, announcing the
fact that 5s. in the £ would be allowed as discount to all customers.
The profit he usually obtained in the ordinary way of trade was 25
per cent., and having had a good season, he was prepared to sell off
the balance of his stock at cost price. The selling price of his
goods was marked in plain figures. A pair of boots which cost him 8s.
was marked 10s., thus showing a profit of 2s., which he considered to
be 25 per cent. (2s. being a quarter of 8s.) Instructions were issued
to all his employees engaged in selling to deduct a quarter from the
marked price, the result being that a pair of boots which cost 8s.,
and marked 10s., was being sold at 7s. 6d. (2s. 6d., the quarter of
the marked price being deducted from 10s.) Although he imagined he
was getting 25 per cent. profit, he was in reality receiving only 20
per cent. It was not long before the posters were altered, announcing
that 4s. in the £ would be allowed to his customers.</p>

<p>The following question was asked some little time ago;&mdash;If a chemist
sold a bottle of medicine for 2s. 6d., which cost him 2½d., what
percentage would be his profit?</p>

<p>Many work out the problem and answer 1100 per cent., but this answer
is incorrect. He received 2s. 6d. for that which cost him 2½d.,
accordingly there was a profit of 2s. 3½d. We must now find out
what percentage is the latter amount of the selling price, 2s. 6d.,
and we discover that it is 91⅔ per cent.</p>

<p class="center">“PUNCH’S” MONEY VAGARIES.</p>

<p>The early Italians used cattle as a currency instead of coin (thus a
bull equals 5s.) and a person would send for change for a thousand
pound bullock, when he would receive 200 five pound sheep. If he
wanted <i>very</i> small change there would be a few lambs amongst them.
The inconvenience of keeping a flock of sheep at one‘s bankers’, or
paying in a short-horned heifer to one’s private account led to the
introduction of <i>bullion</i>.</p>

<p>As to the unhealthy custom of <i>sweating sovereigns</i>, it may be well
to recollect that Charles I., the earliest Sovereign, who was sweated
to such an extent that his immediate successor, Charles II., became
one of the lightest Sovereigns ever known in England.</p>

<p>Formerly every gold watch weighed so many <i>carats</i>, from which it
became usual to call a silver watch a turnip.</p>

<p class="center"><b><big>A Federal Problem.</big></b></p>

<p>It is well known to our readers that paper money&mdash;such as pound
notes&mdash;issued in one colony are depreciated in another; thus a one
pound note of N.S.W. is only worth 19s. 6d. in Victoria, and <i>vice
versa</i>. Some time ago a rather ’cute individual in Wodonga, on the
Victorian side of the border, bought a drink in a local hotel with a
Victorian note, and received in change a N.S.W. note, which was worth
then and there only 19s. 6d.; he thereupon crossed the Murray to
Albury on the New South Wales side, bought another drink for sixpence
with his N.S.W. note, and received a Victorian note equal to 19s.
6d. in change. He travelled backwards and forwards during the day,
getting his twentieth and last drink in Albury, on the N.S.W. side,
whereupon he returns to Wodonga with a Victorian pound note still to
his credit. He thus paid for all his drinks, which amounted to ten
shillings. Who lost the money?</p>

<p>We cannot advise readers to “go thou and do likewise,” for the simple
reason that such a proceeding would now be impossible, as exchange is

for £72 10s. 9d.” The dictation for Class III. began “Now as a lion
prowling about in search, &amp;c.” Of course the poor children heard
both, and got a bit mixed. One little girl’s dictation began “Now a
couple of ducks prowling about in search of a lion who had lost 19s.,

would have been the will of the testator had he foreseen that his wife would
be delivered of twins. As he desired that in case his wife brought
forth a son he should have ⅔ of his property, and the mother ⅓,
it follows that his intention was to give his son a sum double to
that of the mother; and as he desired in the other case that if she
brought forth a daughter the mother should have ⅔ and the daughter ⅓,
there is reason to conclude that he intended the share of the mother
to be double that of the daughter; consequently, to unite these two
conditions, the heritage must be divided in such a manner that the
son may have twice as much as the mother, and the mother twice as
much as the daughter. Thus we get&mdash;</li>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
